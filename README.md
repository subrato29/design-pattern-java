Definition of different Design patterns
--------------------------------------
Creational Design patterns
```
These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further 
divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns.
```

Structural Design patterns
```
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural 
class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces.
```

Behavioral design patterns
```
These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns 
are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects
